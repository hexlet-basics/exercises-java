name: else
theory: |

  #### Briefly

  ```
  if (condition) {
    // code to be executed
    // if the condition is true
  } else {
    // code to be executed
    // if the condition is false
  }
  ```

  Let's try to change the function from the previous example so that it returns not just the sentence type, but the whole string `Sentence is normal` or `Sentence is question`.

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor"); // => Sentence is normal
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor?"); // => Sentence is question
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1);
    var sentenceType = "";
    if (lastChar == '?') {
      sentenceType = "question";
    } else {
      sentenceType = "normal";
    }

    return "Sentence is " + sentenceType;
  }
  ```

  We added `else` and a new block with curly braces. This block will only be executed if the condition in `if` is false.

instructions: |

  Implement the function `normalizeUrl`, which performs the so-called data normalization. It takes the address of the site and returns it with `https://` at the beginning.

  The function accepts addresses in the form `ADDRESS` or `https://ADDRESS`, but always returns the address in the form `https://ADDRESS`

  You can use the `startsWith` function to check if the string starts with the `https://`prefix. And then based on this, add or not add `https://`.

  Call examples:

  ```java
  normalizeUrl('google.com'); // => 'https://google.com'
  normalizeUrl('https://ai.fi'); // => 'https://ai.fi'
  ```
