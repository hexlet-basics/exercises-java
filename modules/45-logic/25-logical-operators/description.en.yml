name: Boolean operators
theory: |

  We already know how to write functions that check for single conditions. Now we will learn to build compound conditions.

  A good example: password check. As you know, some sites when registering want a password of 8 to 20 characters in length. Honestly, this is a strange limitation, but what to do.

  In mathematics we would write `8 < x < 20`, but in Java such a trick will not work (although there are languages ​​in which it will pass).

  We have to make two separate logical expressions and connect them with a special operator "AND":

  ##### Password is longer than 8 characters **AND** password is shorter than 20 characters.

  Here is a function that accepts a password and says whether it meets the conditions (`true`) or does not match (`false`):

  ```java

  public static boolean isCorrectPassword(String password) {
    int length = password.length();
    return length > 8 && length < 20;
  }

  public static void main(String[] agrs) {
    isCorrectPassword("qwerty"); // => false
    isCorrectPassword("qwerty1234"); // => true
    isCorrectPassword("zxcvbnmasdfghjkqwertyui"); // => false
  }
  ```

  `&&` - means "and" (in mathematical logic it is called a conjunction). An entire expression is considered true only if each operand is true — each of the composite expressions. In other words, `&&` means "the one and the other."

  The priority of this operator is lower than the priority of comparison operators, therefore the expression works correctly without parentheses.

  In addition to `&&`, the operator `||` - “OR” (disjunction) is often used. It means "either that, or the other, or both."

  Operators can be combined in any quantity and any sequence, but when `&&` and `||` occur at the same time, it is better to set the priority in brackets.

  Another example. We want to buy an apartment that meets the conditions: an area of ​​100 square meters. meters and more on any street **OR** area of ​​80 square meters. meters and more, but on the main street `Main Street`.

  Write a function that checks the apartment. It takes two arguments: the area (number) and the name of the street (line):

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] agrs) {
    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(91, "Queens Street")); // => false
    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(78, "Queens Street")); // => false
    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(70, "Main Street")); // => false

    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(120, "Queens Street")); // => true
    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(120, "Main Street")); // => true
    System.out.print(isGoodApartment(80, "Main Street")); // => true
  }

  public static boolean isGoodApartment(String area, String street) {
    return area >= 100 || (area >= 80 && "Main Street".equals(street));
  }
  ```

  The area of ​​mathematics in which logical operators are studied is called Boolean algebra. Below are the “truth tables” - from them you can determine what the result of the operator will be:

  #### And `&&`

  | A     | B     | A && B   |
  | ----- | ----- | -------  |
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE    |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | FALSE    |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE    |


  #### OR `||`

  | A     | B     | A \|\| B |
  | ----- | ----- | -------- |
  | TRUE  | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | TRUE  | FALSE | **TRUE** |
  | FALSE | TRUE  | **TRUE** |
  | FALSE | FALSE | FALSE    |

instructions: |

  John instructed Sam to automatically recognize the Lannister soldiers on video. The idea of ​​automating the fortress watch seemed attractive to him. In the process, Sam needed to write a function that determines whether Lannister is in front of him or not. A little thought, Sam highlighted the following rules for determining Lannister:

  ---

  If a soldier has red armor ** And ** there is no shield

  **OR**

  if a soldier has a shield with a lion

  **then this is Lannister**.

  Write the function `isLannisterSoldier`, which takes two arguments as input:

  1. The color of the armor (String). If the armor is red, then the string `red`.
  2. `null` if there is no shield. The string `lion` if there is a shield, and on it is a lion.

  The function returns `true` if Lannister is recognized, and `false` if not recognized.
