name: Ternary operator
theory: |

  #### Briefly

  ```
  <predicate> ? <expression on true> : <expression on false>

  // eg
  number >= 0 ? number : -number;
  ```

  ---

  Look at the definition of the function that returns the module of the transferred number:

  ```java

  public static int abs(int number) {
      if (number >= 0) {
          return number;
      }

      return -number;
  }
  ```

  Is it possible to write it more concisely? Something like `return ANSWER DEPENDING ON CONDITION`? To do this, there must be an expression to the right of return, but `if` is an instruction, not an expression.

  In Java, there is a construct that is similar in its action to the *if-else* construct, but it is an expression. It is called a **ternary operator**.

  The ternary operator is a unique operator requiring three operands:

  ```java

  public static int abs(int number) {
      return number >= 0 ? number : -number;
  }
  ```

  The general pattern is: `<predicate> ? <expression on true> : <expression on false>`.

  Let's rewrite the initial version of `getTypeOfSentence` in the same way:

  It was:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor"); // => normal
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor?"); // => question
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
      var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1);
      if (lastChar == '?') {
          return "question";
      }

      return "normal";
  }
  ```

  It became:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor"); // => normal
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor?"); // => question
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1);
    return (lastChar == '?') ? "question" : "normal";
  }
  ```

  If you remember what the power of expressions is, you probably already guessed that the ternary operator can be nested in the ternary operator. **Do not do this:)** Such code is hard to read and debug, this is a very bad practice.

instructions: |

  Implement the function `convertString`, which accepts a string as input and, if the first letter is not capitalized, returns the string repeated from the source string 2 times. If the first letter is capitalized, the string is returned unchanged.

  Call examples:

  ```java
  convertString("Hello"); // => 'Hello'
  convertString("hello"); // => 'hellohello'
  ```

  You can repeat the line using the function `repeat`.

  Try to write two variants of the function: with the usual if-else, and with the ternary operator.
