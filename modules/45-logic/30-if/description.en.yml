  #### Briefly

  ```
  if (condition) {
    // code to be executed
    // if the condition is true
  }
  ```

  The predicate's task is to get an answer to a question, but usually the code that calls the predicate is not enough and you need to take a certain action depending on the answer.

  We write a function that determines the type of the transferred offer. For starters, it will distinguish regular from interrogative sentences.

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor"); // => "normal"
    getTypeOfSentence("Hodor?"); // => "question"
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1); // способ извлечь последний символ
    if (lastChar == '?') { //lastChar is of type "character", not "string", characters are compared with ==
      return "question";
    }
    return "normal";
  }
  ```

  `if` - instruction. In parentheses, the predicate expression is passed to it, and then the block of code in curly brackets is described. This **сode block will be executed only if the predicate is true**.

  If the predicate is computed to false, then the block of code in braces is skipped, and the function continues its execution.

  In our case, the next line of code - `return "normal";` - causes the function to return a string and end.

  But if the expression that was checked in if turned out to be true, then the block is executed inside {} with the if statement, and the `return "question"` statement. Under normal circumstances, after executing this block {}, the function would continue to execute from the next statement after if. But the return statement inside if causes the function to return "question" as its value, and then not to be executed. Therefore, `return "normal"` will no longer be executed.

  As you can see, `return` can be anywhere in a function. Including inside the code block with the condition.

  ---

  If the curly brackets after `if` contain only one line of code, then you can not write curly brackets and do so:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println(getTypeOfSentence("Hodor")); // => normal
    System.out.printl(getTypeOfSentence("Hodor?")); // => question
  }

  static String getTypeOfSentence(String sentence) {
    var lastChar = sentence.charAt(sentence.length() - 1); // способ извлечь последний символ
    if (lastChar == '?')
      return "question";

    return "normal";
  }
  ```

  We advise you not to do this and **always write curly brackets**. In this case, it is clearly visible where the body of the condition begins and ends. The code becomes more clear and understandable.

instructions: |

  Implement the `getSentenceTone` function, which accepts a string and determines the tone of the sentence. If all the characters are in upper case, then this is the scream `"scream"`. Otherwise, the normal sentence is `"normal"`.

  Algorithm:

  1. Generate an uppercase string based on the str argument string using `str.toUpperCase()`.
  2. Compare it with the source line:
     - If the strings are equal, then the string is an uppercase argument.
     - Otherwise, the string-argument is not uppercase.
