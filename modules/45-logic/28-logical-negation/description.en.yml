name: Negation
theory: |

  Along with the conjunction (**AND**) and the disjunction (**OR**), the operation “**negative**” is often used. Negation changes the logical value to the opposite.

  In programming, it corresponds to the unary operator `!`.

  If there is a function that checks the parity of a number, then using the negation you can perform oddness checking:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    isEven(10);  // => true
    !isEven(10); // => false
  }
  static boolean isEven(int number) {
    return number % 2 == 0;
  }
  ```

  That is, we simply added `!` To the left of the function call and got the opposite effect.

  Denial is a powerful tool that allows you to succinctly express the conceived rules in your code without having to write new functions.

instructions: |

  Implement the `App.isNotLannisterSoldier` function, which checks that the soldier is not a Lannister. The function accepts the input of the same arguments as the function `isLannisterSoldier`:

  1. The color of the armor (string). If the armor is red, then the string `red`.
  2. `null` if there is no shield. The string `lion` if there is a shield, and on it is a lion.

  You can use the ready-to-use function `Functions.isLannisterSoldier`. You can use it to not write all the logical conditions again.
