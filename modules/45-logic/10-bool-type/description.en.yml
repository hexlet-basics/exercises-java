name: Boolean type
theory: |

  In addition to arithmetic operations from school, we know operations of comparison. For example, `5 > 4`. It sounds like the question: "5 is more than 4?". In this case, the answer is "yes." In other cases, the answer may be no (for example, for `3 < 1`).

  List of comparison operations:

  * `<` less
  * `<=` less or equal
  * `>` more
  * `>=` greater or equal
  * `==` equal
  * `!=` not equal

  The logical operation of the type `5 > 4` is an expression, and its result is the value of the logical type. The Java boolean type bool is a value that is written as true or false, for example, var isFivePositive = (5 > 0).

  Let us try to write a function that takes the child’s age in years (integer is an int type) and determines whether the child is a baby. Infants are considered children up to a year:

  ```java
  static boolean isInfant(int age) {
    return age < 1;
  }
  ```

  We take advantage of the fact that any operation is an expression, therefore, with a single line of function, we write “return the value that will be obtained by comparing `age < 1`”.

  Depending on the argument that came in, the comparison will be either true or false , and `return` will return this result.

  Call the function and display the result.

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.print(isInfant(3));
  }

  static boolean isInfant(int age) {
    return age < 1;
  }
  ```

  <pre class = 'hexlet-basics-output'>false</ pre>

  And now let's check a child who is half a year old - zero full years:

  ```java
  System.out.print(isInfant(0));
  ```

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>true</pre>

  Write the function `isPensioner`, which takes the age as the only argument and checks if this age is retirement. Pension is considered the age of 60 years and more.
