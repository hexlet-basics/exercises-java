name: Boolean operators 2
theory: |

  Logical operators - an important topic, so you should fix it with an additional example and exercise.

  Let's try to implement a function that checks the year for leap year. A year will be a leap year, if it is a multiple of 400 or it is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 100. As you can see, the definition already contains all the necessary logic, it remains only to shift it to the code:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    isLeapYear(2018); // => false
    isLeapYear(2017); // => false
    isLeapYear(2016); // => true
  }

  public static boolean isLeapYear(int year) {
    return year % 400 == 0 || (year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 !== 0);
  }
  ```

  We will analyze in parts:

  - the first condition `year% 400 == 0`: the remainder of dividing by 400 is 0, then the number is a multiple of 400
  - `||` **OR**
  - the second condition `(year% 4 == 0 && year% 100! = 0)`
    - `year% 4 == 0`: the remainder of dividing by 4 is 0, so the number is a multiple of 4
    - `&&` ** and **
    - `year% 100! = 0`: the remainder of the division by 100 is not equal to 0, which means that the number is not a multiple of 100


instructions: |

  Write the function `isNeutralSoldier`, which takes two arguments as input:

  1. The color of the armor (string). The options are: "red", "yellow", "black".
  2. The color of the shield (string). The options are: "red", "yellow", "black".

  The function returns `true` if *the color of the armor is not red* and *the color of the shield is black*. In other cases, it returns `false`.

  Call examples:

  ```java
  isNeutralSoldier("yellow", "black"); // => true
  isNeutralSoldier("red", "black");    // => false
  isNeutralSoldier("red", "red");      // => false
  ```
