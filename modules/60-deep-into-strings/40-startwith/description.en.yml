  One of the common tasks when working with strings is to determine whether one string is part of a (other substring) of another string. Most programming languages ​​have a built-in function designed specifically for this task. They are in Java, but it will be useful to write your own implementations.

  ```java
  "Valar Morgulis".indexOf("Morgulis"));  // 6
  ```

  In the example above, the function returns 6, which corresponds to the index of the letter M.

  ```
  "Valar Morgulis".indexOf("Valar"));  // 0
  ```

instructions: |

  Implement the `startsWith` function, which determines whether the string starts with a substring.

  ```
  startsWith("Baratheon", "on"); // false
  startsWith("Baratheon", "Bar"); // true
  ```
