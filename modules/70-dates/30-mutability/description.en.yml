name: Date Modifiability
theory: |

  Unlike all the data types that we dealt with in previous lessons,
  Date values ​​can be changed. In fact, in Java, all types are divided into primitive
  and reference. The values ​​of variables of primitive types are stored in the variable itself, and
  variables of the reference type store not the value itself, but a reference to it. To reference types
  for example, strings and, in some cases, numbers.

  Since reference variables store only a reference to a value, several such variables
  may refer to the same value. For strings or numbers this is not so important, because
  these types are so arranged that they provide no way to change the value. If integer
  integer number is created with a value of 3, then it will always have that value. But meanings
  Date can be changed without changing the link itself, as in this example:

  ```java
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    var date = new Date();
    System.out.print(date.getYear())  // 2019
    showNextYear(date);
    System.out.print(date.getYear()); // 2020
  }

  public static void showNextYear(Date date) {
    date.setYear(date.getYear() + 1);
    System.out.print(date.getYear()); // 2020
  }
  ```

  Do not do this in your functions, such a side effect can make debugging very difficult. If you need to perform any calculations on the date, it is better to create a new instance of Date with the new value of the year, month, day and time - rather than changing the existing one that came into your function from somewhere outside. Other solutions are possible.

  It will not display the current date, as it would after date = new Date (), but the same
  date, but in 2000. And although we submit the same link to print as before, it has changed
  the value to which it points, and the effect of it is almost the same as if
  we reassigned the date variable.

  Besides the fact that in this way you can change the values ​​stored in variables,
  without changing the variables themselves, the same rule applies to function arguments.
  By passing to the Date function, we cannot be sure that this function will not change it.
  (as we already know, such a change to something outside the function will be ** a side effect **).
  At this stage of training, we are not ready to give any recommendations on this matter,
  but since the previous lessons affirmed the immutability of function arguments, it is useful
  be aware of this possibility of circumventing this immutability: of course, the variables passed
  into a function, it will not change, but here are the Date values ​​to which these variables point -
  can change, and the effect from the point of view of the calling code may be the same.

  Create the date variable, then set it 2000 year and output the date in the format `dd/mm/yyyy`.
