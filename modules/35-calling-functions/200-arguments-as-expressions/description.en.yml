name: Arguments as expressions
theory: |

  Consider this code:

  ```java
  var result = Math.min(1, 5);
  ```

  The `Math.min` function is called with the arguments `1` and `5`.

  We found out that *expressions turn into values ​*. That is, from the Java point of view, values ​​and expressions are something similar. Therefore, any values ​​in the program can technically be replaced by expressions.

  When calling a function, you can pass an expression **into it with the argument**:

  ```java
  var result = Math.min(1, 2 + 3);
  ```

  The result will be the same as in the first example, because the expression `2 + 3` will turn into the value `5`, and `Math.min` will be called with the arguments `1` and `5`.

  Moreover, you can use variables interspersed with values ​​and other expressions:

  ```java
  var number = 2 + 2;
  var result = Math.min(1, 1 + number);
  ```

  Naturally, this works not only with numbers, but with any values ​​and expressions. For example, with strings.

  Let's summarize. Take a look at a few examples from the current lesson:

  ```java

  // simple calls
  var result = Math.min(1, 5);       // 1

  // expressions in arguments
  var result = Math.min(1, 2 + 3);   // 1

  // expressions with variables in arguments
  var number = 2 + 2;
  var result = Math.min(1, 1 + number);  // 1
  ```

  Notice the similarity: in all calls, some information is passed to the function, but sometimes this is a simple, “ready” value, and sometimes a compound expression is “not ready” value (`2 + 3`, `1 + number`, etc. ). In this case, in all examples two arguments are passed.

  The function `calculateDistanceBetweenTowns` is available to you. It takes one argument, which must contain the names of the two cities through a hyphen. In response, it returns the distance between these cities. Here is an example of use:

  ```java
  var distance = calculateDistanceBetweenTowns("Lannisport-Bayasabhad");
  ```

  Write a program that uses the `calculateDistanceBetweenTowns` function and displays the distance between cities recorded in the `from` and `to` variables.
