  The `Math.min` function, which returns the minimum number of two, takes 2 parameters. If you call `Math.min` without parameters, Java will display the following: `no suitable method found for Math.min(no arguments)`. We are told that such a function Math.min without parameters does not exist.

  How do we know how many parameters need the `Math.min` function and what type of value does it return? We looked at the ** signature ** of this function. The signature determines the input parameters and their types, also the output parameter and its type. You can read about the function `Math.min` in [official Java documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html).

  You can pass parameters only in the sequence in which they are defined in the signature.

  Any function always returns only one value (unless the type of the result is void, then it returns nothing). At the same time, the return value can be of a complex type and represent, for example, a list of some values.

  In Java, the String class has a function `concat`. Examine its signature at [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#concat(java.lang.String]].

  Write a program that uses the `concat` function with the` text` variable and displays the result on the screen.
