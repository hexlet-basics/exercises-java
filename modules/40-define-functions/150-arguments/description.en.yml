name: Arguments, variables and instructions
theory: |

  Newbies sometimes try to do something like this function definition:

  ```java
  static void showDate("Today is: December 5") {
    // some code
  }
  ```

  Run the code does not work - it contains a syntax error. Instead of a variable, a string is written in the argument, that is, a value.

  **The argument must be a variable**, otherwise it cannot be an argument, that is, something that *takes a value when invoked*.

  If you need some information in the function, and you know in advance which one, then the argument is not needed for this, because we already know how to save values ​​for later use - just create a variable in the body itself:

  ```java
  public static void showDate() {
    var text = "Today is: December 5";
    // some code
  }
  ```

  ---

  Note: after defining the function (after the closing brace), we do not put `;`.

  The symbol `;` is placed at the end of expressions. **The function definition is not an expression, but an instruction**. Accordingly, we cannot use it as part of other expressions and it doesn’t need `;` at the end.

  The concept “create function” has many synonyms: “implement”, “define” and even “implement” (from the word implement). All of them are found in everyday practice at work.

  Sam makes a lot of cards, and he often needs to display repeated symbols to visualize routes. For example, as Sam illustrates the narrow roads between cities:

  ```
  Meereen =-=-=-=- Myr
  ```

  And so illustrates the wide trails:

  ```
  Vaes Dothrak ======== Vahar
  ```

  Sam somewhere found the function `repeat` from the class `Functions`. It takes two arguments: some number N and a string, and returns a string repeated N times. Here is how he uses it:

  ```java
  System.out.print(Functions.repeat(4));
  ```

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>=-=-=-=-</pre>

  Sam is not very pleased. It is inconvenient to call `repeat` hundreds of times inside the` System.out.print` call.

  Write for Sam the function `printSeq`, which itself displays the resulting repetitions. It takes two arguments, a string and a number, and prints a repeating string to the screen. To generate a string, use `repeat`.

  Here is an example of how Sam would use the `printSeq` you wrote:

  ```java
  App.printSeq("=-", 4);
  ```

  <pre class='hexlet-basics-output'>=-=-=-=-</pre>

  As usual, the function needs to be public static, not just static, so that we can call it from another class.
