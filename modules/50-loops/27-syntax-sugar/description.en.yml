name: Syntax sugar
theory: |

  Similar constructions `index = index + 1` in Java are used quite often, so the creators of the language added an abbreviated version of the record: `index + = 1`.

  It is important to understand that the differences are only in the way of recording.

  Such abbreviations are called “**syntactic sugar**”, because they make the process of writing code a little easier and more pleasant, “sweetening” it :)

  There are abbreviated forms for all arithmetic operations and for string concatenation:

  - `a = a + 1` → `a += 1`
  - `a = a - 1` → `a -= 1`
  - `a = a * 2` → `a *= 2`
  - `a = a / 1` → `a /= 1`
  - `a = a +" bla"` → `a +="bla"`

  Implement the `countChars` function, which counts repetitions of the specified character in a string. (In programming, they say "the number of occurrences of a character in a string").

  The function takes two parameters as input: a string and a character. The function returns a number.

  Call example:

  ```java
  var str = "If I look back I am lost";
  countChars(str, 'I'); // => 3
  countChars(str, 'z'); // => 0
  countChars(str, 'o'); // => 3
  ```

  The idea is to create a separate counter variable and increment it by 1 each time the specified character is found in a line. You will need to nest a conditional statement in the loop body. To increase the counter, use syntactic sugar.
