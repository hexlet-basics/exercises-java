name: Extract characters from string
theory: |

  Sometimes you need to get one character from a string. For example, if the site knows the user's first and last name, and at some point you need to display this information in the format `A. Ivanov`, then you need to take the first character from the name.

  ```java
  var firstName = "Alexander";

  System.out.print(firstName.charAt(0)); // => A
  ```

  charAt(int index) is a special method for extracting a character from a string. **Index** is the position of the character within the string. Indices start with 0 in almost all programming languages ​​- therefore, to get the first character, you need to specify the index `0`.

  An index can be not only a specific number, but also the value of a variable. Here is an example that will lead to the same result - displaying the `A` symbol on the screen, but the index inside the square brackets is written not by a number, but by a variable:

  ```
  var firstName = "Alexander";
  var index = 0;

  System.out.print(firstName.charAt(index)); // => A
  ```

  Although the character is not a string, the concatenation operation (+) can work if one of the arguments is a character. It will make a string of it and compute it as a concatenation of two strings. But don't try to concatenate characters with each other, not with a string - the Java compiler will decide that you want to add the numeric codes of these characters, and the result will be some number.

  ```java
  System.out.print('H' + 'A'); // => 137
  System.out.print('H' + " " + 'A');  // => "H A"
  ```

instructions: |

  You are given three variables with the names of different people. Compose and display a word of characters in this order:

  1. the third character from the first line;
  2. the second character from the second line;
  3. the fourth character from the third line;
  4. the fifth character from the second line;
  5. the third character from the second line.

  The output should be something like this: "a b c d e"
