name: Errors when working with variables

theory: |

  The main rule: a variable must be declared before it is used. If you do this later, the program simply will not work.

  ```java
  System.out.print(greeting);
  greeting = "Father!";
  ```

  The launch of the program the above ends with an error:

  Error: java: cannot find symbol
  symbol: variable greeting

  This error means that the code uses a variable that is not defined. And in the error itself they say this directly: variable greeting. In addition to the wrong order of definition, in Java there are commonplace typos, both when using a variable and when it is declared.

  The number of such errors is reduced by using a properly configured editor. This editor highlights the names that are used without the announcement and warns of possible problems.

instructions: |
  Find an undeclared variable in the program and declare it assigning to it the value of `"Dragon"`;
