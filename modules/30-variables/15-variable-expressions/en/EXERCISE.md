Write a program that takes the original amount of euros recorded in the variable `eurosCount`, converts the euro into dollars and displays on the screen. Then, the resulting value translates into rubles and displays on the new line.

Example withdrawal for 100 euros:

```
125.0
7500.0
```

We believe that:
- 1 euro = 1.25 dollars
- 1 dollar = 60 rubles
