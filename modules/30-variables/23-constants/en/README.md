Some data, such as mathematical constants, never changes. Take the number π. Approximately it is always equal to `3.14` and cannot change.

To access such data in Java, it is customary to use constants.

```java
final var pi = 3.14;
System.out.print(pi); // 3.14
```

A constant, like a variable, can be used in any expression. The only restriction is that the constant cannot be changed, which sounds quite logical.
